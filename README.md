## 💻 School projects 2021-2023

Gathering some of my tasks done at Laurea-ammattikorkeakoulu

At the moment this repo includes: 
- ☕️ Java exercises done as first programming exercises (*not the prettiest code as I had not coded before*)
- 🐍 Python exercises done as additional studies (*enjoying Python's syntax or the lack of it*)
- 🖥 Basic website design course with HTML and CSS

Coming spring 2022:
- JavaScript exercises
- old SQL queries from spring 2021
